title: Auto-Sequencing & Duration Shorthand

# Auto-Sequencing & Duration Shorthand

For `video`, `image`, and `audio` clips, you can reduce timeline boilerplate with two shortcuts:

- **`duration`** — use instead of `end`. The library computes `end = position + duration`. You cannot specify both on the same clip.
- **Omit `position`** — the clip is placed immediately after the previous clip on its track. Video and image clips share the visual track; audio clips have their own track. The first clip defaults to `position: 0`.

```ts
// Before: manual position and end for every clip
await project.load([
  { type: "video", url: "./a.mp4", position: 0, end: 5 },
  { type: "video", url: "./b.mp4", position: 5, end: 10 },
  { type: "video", url: "./c.mp4", position: 10, end: 18, cutFrom: 3 },
]);

// After: auto-sequencing + duration shorthand
await project.load([
  { type: "video", url: "./a.mp4", duration: 5 },
  { type: "video", url: "./b.mp4", duration: 5 },
  { type: "video", url: "./c.mp4", duration: 8, cutFrom: 3 },
]);
```

## Mixing explicit and implicit positioning

You can mix explicit `position` values with auto-sequenced clips freely. Clips with an explicit `position` are placed there; subsequent auto-sequenced clips follow from the last placed clip's end:

```ts
await project.load([
  { type: "video", url: "./a.mp4", duration: 5 },        // position: 0, end: 5
  { type: "video", url: "./b.mp4", position: 10, end: 15 }, // explicit gap
  { type: "video", url: "./c.mp4", duration: 5 },        // position: 15, end: 20
]);
```

## Text overlays require explicit timing

Text clips always need an explicit `position` (and `end` or `duration`) — they target specific visual moments and don't participate in track sequencing.

Background music and subtitle clips have their own defaults (`position: 0`, `end: project duration`) and also don't auto-sequence.
